The model data that will be used in this DBT walk through consists of 3 tables.
Customers, Sales and Products. Customers include the name of a customer, id and a location (where they are based).
Products includes a product id, name and a category.
Sales include sale id, product id, customer id and sale amount.
Over time, more tables will be created as we model and generate new tables for a fictional analytics team.

All tables can be found in the bq project.

Our goal will be to create a bunch of marts tables and tests that will be used by a fictional analytics team.
